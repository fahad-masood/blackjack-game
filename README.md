- This is a practice project made using HTML, CSS, JS

## Features

- Follows the basic rules of Blackjack game also known as 21
- Don't worry about suits or face cards; "cards" will have values from 2-11, and all values are equally likely (that is, unlike a real blackjack game, there's no greater chance of drawing a card with value 10).
- After clicking on Start Game, 2 random cards will be drawn and shown to you.
- Allows the player to draw a "new card" as many times as he/she would like until he/she gets a blackjack(sum = 21) or a value greater than 21.
- If the player is able to get exact 21 as sum, he/she wins the blackjack.
- If the value is more than 21, he/she will get "busted" i.e., lose the game.
